## Overview

The application is written in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

We're using ERB ~~[Slim](http://slim-lang.com/)~~(moving away from it) as our HTML templating language, ES6 JavaScript and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling compiled with webpacker.

We're using [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) as our background processor to do things like send emails and handle attachments.

We're processing attachments using our [antivirus API](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-antivirus) for antivirus checking and [Imagemagick](http://imagemagick.org) for thumbnailing.


## Getting set up

See [getting set up](doc/getting-set-up.md).

## Contributing

See [contributing](CONTRIBUSING.md).

## Accounts

### Keycloak

The development instance of Keycloak is configured with the following default user accounts:

* Internal user: `user@example.com` / `password`
* Trading Standards user: `msa@example.com` / `password`
* Admin Console: `admin` / `admin`

Log in to the [Keycloak admin console](http://keycloak:8080/auth/admin) to add/edit users or to obtain client credentials.

Ask someone on the team to create an account for you on the Int and Staging environments.


## GOV.UK Notify

If you want to send emails from your development instance, or update any API keys for the deployed instances, you'll need an account for [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk) - ask someone on the team to invite you.


## GOV.UK Platform as a Service

If you want to update any of the deployed instances, you'll need an account for [GOV.UK PaaS](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) - ask someone on the team to invite you.


## Amazon Web Services

We're using AWS for file storage on the S3 service. You'll need an account - ask someone on the team to invite you. If you get an error saying you don't have permission to set something, make sure you have MFA set up.


## Deployment

See [deployment](doc/deployment.md).

#### Logging

##### Fluentd

We're using [fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) to aggregate the logs and send them to both an [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) and S3 bucket for long term storage.

#### Logit

We're using [Logit](https://logit.io) as a hosted ELK stack.
If you want to view the logs, you'll need an account - ask someone on the team to invite you.
You should sign up using GitHub OAuth to ensure MFA.

[logstash-filters.conf](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-infrastructure/blob/master/logstash-filters.conf) provides a set of rules which logstash can use to parse logs.


#### S3

We're using AWS S3 as a long term storage for logs.
See [AWS section](#amazon-web-services) for more details about setting up an account.


### Monitoring

#### Metrics

Our metrics are sent to an ELK stack and S3 using [the paas-metric-exporter app](./paas-metric-exporter).

We have set up a regular job to query the database and to print certain metrics into the logs. This was all done in [PR #962](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss/pull/962).
The metrics are sent in JSON format and logstash is clever enough to split these out into separate logs for each key-value pair.
However, you will need to add an extra filter in [logstash-filters.conf](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-infrastructure/blob/master/logstash-filters.conf), in order to create new fields on the logs instead of the data all being captured in the `message` field.
