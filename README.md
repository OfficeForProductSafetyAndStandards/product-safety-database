# Product Safety Database

The Product Safety Database is the place to create notifications for unsafe or non-compliant products. It is used by OPSS and local authority trading standards teams to log and share information about unsafe or non-compliant products.

Built by the [Office for Product Safety and Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-product-safety-and-standards).

For enquiries, contact [opss.enquiries@businessandtrade.gov.uk](mailto:opss.enquiries@businessandtrade.gov.uk).

## Technical overview

The application is written in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

We're using ERB as our HTML templating language, ES6 JavaScript and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling.

We're using [Sidekiq](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq) as our background processor to do things like send emails and handle attachments.

We're processing attachments using our [antivirus API](https://github.com/OfficeForProductSafetyAndStandards/antivirus) for antivirus checking and [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/) for thumbnailing.
