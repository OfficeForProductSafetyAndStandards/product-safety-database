## Overview

The application is written in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

We're using ERB as our HTML templating language, ES6 JavaScript and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling.

We're using [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) as our background processor to do things like send emails and handle attachments.

We're processing attachments using our [antivirus API](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-antivirus) for antivirus checking and [Imagemagick](http://imagemagick.org) for thumbnailing.
