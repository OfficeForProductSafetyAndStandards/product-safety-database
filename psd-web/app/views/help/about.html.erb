      <a name="introduction"></a>
      An introduction to the Product safety database (PSD)
    </h2>

    <p>
      The Product safety database replaces RAPEX and ICSMS in the UK. It helps market surveillance authorities (MSAs) including Trading Standards (TS) teams in local authorities report, track and share product safety information.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment you can use it to:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        report safety and compliance issues by creating ‘cases’
      </li>
      <li>
        assign cases to other local authorities or organisations, and track their progress
      </li>
      <li>
        receive alerts from OPSS about serious product safety issues
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="when-to-use-the-psd"></a>
      When to use the PSD
    </h2>

    <p>
      You should use the PSD to share information about products that do not comply with the relevant legislation.
    </p>

    <p>
      You must notify OPSS if you:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        find a consumer product on the market which presents a serious risk (as determined by a risk assessment)
      </li>
      <li>
        receive a notification under Regulation 9 of the General Product Safety Regulations 2005 (GPSR)
      </li>
      <li>
        take action to restrict the availability of a consumer product on the market because it breaches the requirements of the GPSR (including withdrawal and recall)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You should also use the PSD to share information about products that are non-compliant with the relevant product safety legislation.
    </p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="how-to-judge-the-level-of-risk"></a>
      How to judge the level of risk
    </h2>

    <p>
      Use the <%= link_to "RAPEX risk assessment guidelines", "https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer-safety/rag/#/screen/home", class: "govuk-link" %> to determine the level of risk and decide whether the product safety issue is ‘serious’. The assessment results will dictate how quickly you must add information about the product onto the PSD.
    </p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="reporting-serious-risks"></a>
      Reporting serious risks
    </h2>

    <p>
      Until the end of the implementation period (31 December 2020), the UK still needs to pass on notifications of serious risk to the European Commission and other EU member states through RAPEX.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should add the relevant information to the PSD, and OPSS will add it to RAPEX on your behalf. When you report a product that presents a serious risk, you should:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        immediately change the case owner to OPSS Incident Management team and include ‘Serious risk notification’ in the message to the new case owner
      </li>
      <li>
        respond quickly to requests for additional information 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      OPSS is the UK national contact point for RAPEX and will pass on notifications of serious risk submitted to the PSD to RAPEX on your behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      When OPSS receives a RAPEX alert from another EU member state about a serious risk they will add the information to the PSD. It will be visible and searchable to registered users. OPSS will then make the relevant local authority the case owner, who should take action.
    </p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="what-youll-be-asked-for-when-you-report-information"></a>
      What you’ll be asked for when you report information
    </h2>

    <p>
      The details needed are similar to a RAPEX case.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PSD asks for details on:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        the product you are reporting
      </li>
      <li>
        the issues you have found
      </li>
      <li>
        businesses involved
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And if you have them, you can add details on:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        corrective actions planned or taken
      </li>
      <li>
        test results
      </li>
      <li>
        risk assessments
      </li>
      <li>
        product and evidence images
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You must only share personal data and other information on the database if you have the necessary consent or power to do so and acting in compliance with the law (including data protection and intellectual property law).
    </p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="report-early-and-add-details-when-they-are-available"></a>
      Report early and add details when they are available
    </h2>

    <p>
      You should use the PSD to record information that has raised any level of concern – even if the issue is not yet proven, or you’re waiting for test results.
    </p>

    <p>
      As more evidence is gathered (such as test results or risk assessments) it can be added to the case. OPSS is encouraging the product safety community to report product safety information earlier than it did on RAPEX and ICSMS.
    </p>

    <p>
      All users should share information early so that it’s possible to see when other market surveillance authorities have:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        raised concerns about a product or business
      </li>
      <li>
        tested a product and shared the results
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This will help save time and money, and prevent duplication of effort.
    </p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      OPSS reports product safety information too
    </h3>

    <p>
      OPSS monitors the media and product safety websites in Europe, Canada, the US and Australia for new consumer product safety information. When OPSS finds anything that relates to products found on the UK market, it adds them to the PSD and makes the relevant local authority the case owner.
    </p>



    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="organisations-with-access-to-the-psd"></a>
      Organisations with access to the PSD
    </h2>

    <p>
      Only authorised users can view case details in the database. People from the following organisations have access to the PSD:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS)
      </li>
      <li>
        Local authority Trading Standards in England, Scotland and Wales
      </li>
      <li>
        Environment Health Northern Ireland
      </li>
      <li>
        Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
      </li>
      <li>
        Health and Safety Executive Northern Ireland (HSENI)
      </li>
      <li>
        Marine and Coastguard Agency (MCGA)
      </li>
      <li>
        Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA)
      </li>
      <li>
        Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA)
      </li>
      <li>
        Ofcom
      </li>
    </ul>



    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="restricted-cases"></a>
      Restricted cases
    </h2>

    <p>
      The information shared in the PSD can only be seen by registered users from market surveillance authorities and the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS). Teams can ‘restrict’ cases which means that only teams that are ‘involved’ in a case – meaning that they are the case owner or have been added to the case – can view it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aim of the Product safety database is to share information within the product safety community to save time, effort and money. Therefore, cases should only be restricted in exceptional circumstances, for example, if it is going to court or contains commercially sensitive information that should not be visible to teams that are not involved.
    </p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="using-the-psd-as-a-team"></a>
      Using the PSD as a team
    </h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Giving your team access to the PSD
    </h3>

    <p>
      Officers who lead on product safety from each organisation have been given a PSD account and made a ‘team administrator’. Once they’ve set up their own account, they can invite other colleagues – from their organisation only – to create an account too. They can do this by going to the ‘Your team’ part of the service, adding their colleague’s email address and choosing ‘Invite’.
    </p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Administrators can add another administrator
    </h3>

    <p>
      If there’s someone in the team whose responsibilities make them better placed to be an administrator – for example, they will regularly lead    work connected with the PSD – invite them to create an account. You can then email <%= mail_to t(:enquiries_email), nil, class: "govuk-link" %> and ask for them   to be made a team admin.
    </p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Cases created by you or your team
    </h3>

    <p>
      When you or someone on your team creates a case, you and each of your team members will be able to view all details relating to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will also be able to edit most details (however, any changes made will be recorded in the activity log).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also change the case owner to:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        yourself
      </li>
      <li>
        someone else in your team
      </li>
      <li>
        an external team
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Cases created by other teams
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you and your team are not involved in a case, you will be able to view most details, except some information protected by GDPR, for example,     consumer contact details.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the you are made the case owner, you can add the information asked for.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have product safety information that’s relevant to the case, you can add it. The case creator and their team will be notified.
    </p>

    <p>
      There will be occasions when a case is marked as ‘restricted’. In those instances, you will be able to see that a case exists but you will not    be able to see further details unless you are involved in the case.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, OPSS users can see the details of all restricted cases.
    </p>

      How to change the case owner
    </h2>

    <p>Only the current case owner can change case ownership.</p>

    <p>
      To change the case owner to another authority or organisation, you need to navigate to the ‘sharing and collaboration’ section of the case overview.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      <a name="update-your-account-details"></a>
      Update your account details
