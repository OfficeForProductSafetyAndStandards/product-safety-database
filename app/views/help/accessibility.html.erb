    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible the Product Safety Database is</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Parts of the Product Safety Database are not fully accessible. For example, there is only one method to find a web page in a set, some content isn't visible, and the focus order is inconsistent. </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard. The Product Safety Database is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed in the non-accessible content section. </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

    <ul class="govuk-body">
      <li>The colour contrast ratio of a few elements is less than 4.5:1. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast (Minimum)).</li>
      
      <li>Some buttons are not accessible by keyboard. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard).</li>
      
      <li>Having multiple "Skip to main content" links, such as one at the top of the page and another at the start of the menu items, can be confusing for screen reader users. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.1(Bypass Blocks).</li>
      
      <li>Hidden content is announced, keyboard focus is not visible on checkboxes, and focus does not remain visible on buttons when expanded or collapsed. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.7 (Focus Visible).</li>
      
      <li>Some table headers are empty and form fields lack labels. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions).</li>
      
      <li>Some links do not revert users automatically to their respective contents. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus Order).</li>
      
      <li>Pagination is defined as links, the current page isn't identified, buttons are mislabeled as links or list boxes, and some content is incomplete or missing. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).</li>
      
      <li>Status Messages for various user actions are missing. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.3 (Status Messages).</li>
      
      <li>Error messages are absent for empty fields, and success messages are displayed even with incorrect or missing information. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.3 (Error Suggestion).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">PDFs and other documents</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Live video</h3>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations. </p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We encourage businesses to ensure that the documents they upload to the Product Safety Database are accessible. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We also plan to fix the existing accessibility issues soon to remove the barriers for differently abled people.</p>
