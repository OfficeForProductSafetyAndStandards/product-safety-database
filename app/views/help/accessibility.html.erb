    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about the accessibility of the Product safety database</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">OPSS is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Product safety database is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-accessible content</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The skip links do not move the user’s visual focus to the relevant input field. This fails WCAG 2.1A 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks). We plan to fix this by December 2020.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Product safety database allows local authorities and market surveillance authorities to upload documents they have produced to share information and manage investigations. This third-party content is neither funded nor developed by OPSS and is not under its control. As such it is exempt under section 4(2)(e) of the accessibility regulations.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We will encourage local authorities and market surveillance authorities to ensure that the documents they upload to the Product safety database are accessible.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested the Product safety database</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">This statement was prepared on 6 August 2020.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Product safety database was last tested on 25 February 2020. The test was carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The website was given a manual technical audit with automated tools and tested by a team with differing disabilities using a range of adaptive technologies. A small number of accessibility issues were reported and have been resolved apart from the non-compliance identified above.</p>
