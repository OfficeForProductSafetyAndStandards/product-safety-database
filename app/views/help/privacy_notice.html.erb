Google Analytics stores information about: the pages you visit, how long you spend on each page, how you got to the site, and what you click on while you’re visiting the site. We do not collect or store your personal information as part of the analytics process so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. We also collect data in order to:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>We will take steps to anonymise information wherever possible when sharing information with third parties. The process of anonymisation removes the personal identifiers from the information and thus means that the information no longer contains Personal Data.</p>
