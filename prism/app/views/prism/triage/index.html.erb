    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Determine and evaluate the level of risk presented by a consumer product</h1>
    <p class="govuk-body-l">The assessment is part of the recently introduced Product Safety Risk Assessment Methodology (PRISM) and intended for organisations responsible for market surveillance and enforcement.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Although <abbr title="Product Safety Risk Assessment Methodology">PRISM</abbr> is primarily aimed at evaluating the risks associated with non-food consumer goods, regulatory bodies in charge of other product categories may also find it beneficial, either in whole or in part.</p>
