# Getting set up

## Installing the application

First, clone the Git repository and `cd` into it within a terminal prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-psd.git
cd beis-opss-psd
```

### 1. Install prequisites

The application requires several backing services to run. Install these:

* [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/install-elasticsearch.html) - version 6 (you can also install this via Docker, see below)

### 1.1 Install supporting services via Docker

Some of the dependencies are easier to install via Docker. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) if you have not already done so, and then run:

```bash
docker-compose build antivirus
```

### 2. Install Ruby and gem dependencies

The application is written in Ruby using the Rails framework.

You need to install the right version of Ruby - see [Gemfile](./Gemfile). To do this, you could use either [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) – these allow you to have multiple different versions of Ruby installed at the same time.

Once you’ve installed the right version of Ruby, you can install the Ruby gem dependencies by running this command:

```bash
bundle install
```


### 3. Install Node and npm dependencies

Node modules are used for front-end dependencies (CSS, javascript and images).

First install the right version of node using [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (nvm). The current version used is specified in the [package.json](./package.json) file.

Then install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Once these are both installed, run this command:

```bash
yarn install
```

to install npm dependencies.

### 4. Configure your local environment

Some settings are configured within a hidden file called `.env.development`. You will need to create this - you can copy the example in [`.env.development.example`](./.env.development.example):

```bash
cp .env.development.example .env.development
```

You will need to edit this file to add:

* [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk) API key
* Your mobile number to `TWO_FACTOR_AUTH_MOBILE_NUMBER` so that when using the seeded user you will receive the two factor authentication code. Alternatively you cab set `TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED=false` to bypass two factor authentication in development mode.



### 5. Setup the database

Create and populate the database:

```bash
bundle exec bin/rake db:setup
```

## Running the application

To compile the front-end assets (and have them re-compile as you make changes), run:

```bash
bundle exec bin/webpack-dev-server
```

Start the application:

```bash
bundle exec bin/rails server
bundle exec bin/sidekiq
```

## Running the tests

Copy the file called `.env.test.example` to `.env.test`, and modify as appropriate.

New tests are written in RSpec. There should be a feature spec covering new user journeys, and unit testing of all code components.

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

There is also a legacy test suite written with Minitest. This is deprecated and tests are being gradually moved over to RSpec. To run it:

```bash
bin/rails test
```

You can run the Ruby linting with `bin/rubocop`. Running this with the `-a` flag set will cause Rubocop to attempt to fix as many of the issues as it can.

You can run the Slim linting with `bin/slim-lint app`.

You can run the Sass linting with `bin/yarn sass-lint -vq 'app/**/*.scss'`.

You can run the JavaScript linting with `bin/yarn eslint app config`.

You can run the security vulnerability static analysis with `bin/brakeman --no-pager`.
