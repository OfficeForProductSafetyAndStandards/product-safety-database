# Roles

Users of the Product Safety Database will normally not require any specific roles to be defined in order to use the service. Exceptionally they may have one or more roles which allow them to perform priveleged actions not ordinarily available to other users.

Roles may be applied to users individually, or to a whole team. When a role is applied to a team, it is inferred that all users within that team are assigned that role.

Accordingly, roles are defined in the `Role` model which may be associated with the `User` and/or `Team` models. The role is defined by the `name` attribute of the `Role` model.

The available role names and their meanings are described below:

| Role name    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
